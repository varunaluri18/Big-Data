Hadoop
Core Services/Daemons 
. Name Node
. Secondary Name Node
. Data Node
. Job Tracker
. Task Tracker

Data storage and processing
Data Analysis
Data Warehouse
NOSQL DB - MongoDB, Cassandra
Realtime Processing - spark
Messaging System - kafka

Hadoop Core Componenets
. HDFS - Hadoop Distributed File System
. Map Reduce - Data Processing
. YARN - Yet Another Resource Negotiaton (Resource Management)

Map Reduce
Key Value pair
If different mapper outputs(k,v) coming from a single node contains duplicate
They will get combined locally reduced as a single(k,v)
MR performs distributed and parallel computation using large datasets across large no of nodes

Two Daemons of Map Reduce
Job Tracker
Task Tracker

Hadoop 2 .0 onwards(YARN)
Resource Manager
Node Manager
.Job client submits the job to the resource manager
.YRAN RM scheduler is responsible for the co-ordination of resource allocation of the cluster
.YARN NM runs on each node and does node level resource management ,co-ordinating with the RM .It will launch and monitor comput containers on the machine


sqoop - Load structured data
Flume - Load unstructured data
WORM - Write once read many 

Pig - Load any type of data
Hive - Act like as Data Ware House
HBase - NoSQL database
Impala - It is from Cloudera(25% faster than map reduce)
